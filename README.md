# Edmonds-karp
 Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network in O(|V| |E|2) time.
 
 Through the graphic interface you can:
  - create/delete/modify a graph;
  - simulate every step of the algorithm (undo, pause, forward, autoplay)
  - choose different implementation of the algorith.
  - save/load previous graph.
